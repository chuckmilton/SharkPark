Executive Summary


SharkPark is a mobile application designed to address one of the most common complaints faced by CSULB students and staff, the lack of parking. With approximately 40,000 students competing for 14,000 spaces, demand consistently exceeds supply during peak hours, resulting in wasted time, increased frustration, and negative impacts on both academic performance and the environment. SharkPark provides a modern, data-driven approach to this longstanding problem by transforming students’ mobile devices into privacy preserving sensors that contribute real time parking occupancy data.


The system works by leveraging geofencing and activity recognition on student phones to capture anonymous “enter” and “leave” events as vehicles arrive and depart. These signals are aggregated by a backend service that applies machine learning models to estimate current lot occupancy and generate short and long term forecasts. Students using the app benefit from up to date parking availability, personalized lot recommendation based on location and predicted demand, and fallback options if their lot of choice is near or at capacity.


Beyond individual convenience, SharkPark supports broader institutional goals. Campus Parking Services and university administration gain valuable insights into usage trends, peak demand times, and the impact of special events, enabling data-informed planning and policy decisions. Integration with shuttle services and third-party data further enhances forecasting accuracy and provides students with multimodal commuting options.


Key design principles include privacy, efficiency, and scalability. The app is designed to minimize battery consumption by batching events and using low power sensors, while ensuring that no personally identifiable information or raw GPS tracks are stored. The backend architecture is modular and scalable, capable of handling thousands of concurrent users and spikes in demand around class start times. By prioritizing lightweight and cost effective mobile sensing over infrastructure heavy solutions such as cameras or fixed sensors, SharkPark ensures long term feasibility and adaptability.


Ultimately, SharkPark aims to reduce the average time spent searching for parking, lower commuter stress, and contribute to sustainability by cutting down on unnecessary driving. For students, this means fewer late arrivals and a smoother start to their days. For the university, it means improved operational efficiency and a better commuter experience that enhances the overall perception of campus life. By bridging real time technology with practical commuter needs, SharkPark offers a forward looking solution to one of CSULB’s most persistent challenges.
Stakeholder Model


Stakeholders represent all parties that contribute to or are impacted by SharkPark. Below we define the primary stakeholders, their roles, responsibilities, and expected deliverables. Primary stakeholders include Students and faculty (app users), Developers and Devops (build and maintain systems), Campus Transit (shuttle information), and Third-Party Services (weather, maps). Each stakeholder group has specific expectations: app users provide anonymous signals and feedback, parking services may supply lot metadata and event schedules, and the development team ensures system reliability and data privacy.

Goal Model


The primary goal of SharkPark is to reduce the amount of time students spend searching for parking and to improve the reliability of student commuting. This primary goal is supported by Business Goals to increase satisfaction and provide campus insights, Usage Goals for accurate real time occupancy and clear recommendations, and System goals towards privacy first, reliability, and scalability. The diagram below visualizes how the primary goal is broken up into these categories.
1. Primary Goals: These goals are designed to reduce the time students and faculty spend on parking and improve overall commuting experience. They provide real-time information and predictive analytics to enable users to plan ahead.
2. Business Goals: These goals seek to minimize frustration and improve overall satisfaction with their parking experience. They deliver data analytics to aid CSULB’s Parking and Transportation Services in decision making, lot management, and event planning.
3. Usage Goals: These goals provide users with real-time analytics, aggregated occupancy, and suggested lot displayed with status indicators. They offer personalized recommendations based on forecasted demand and estimated availability to improve parking efficiency.
4. System Goals: These goals ensure user privacy through the anonymous collection of entry and exit events without personal identifiers or history. They are focused on scalability, reliability, and energy efficiency through optimized background processing.
  

System Vision


SharkPark’s vision is a privacy preserving, low cost parking guidance system that uses mobile phones as anonymous sensors. Student devices detect entry/exit geofenced lots and send minimal events to the backend. The backend aggregates events, estimates lot occupancy, runs short and long term forecasting models, and exposes APIs for the mobile client dashboard. The system will support offline caching, battery optimized background processing, and careful degradation when data is sparse.  


Usage Model
The usage model for SharkPark describes how students, faculty and the system interact to reduce parking frustration and improve the commuting experience. Students and faculty (end users) open the SharkPark mobile app to view real-time parking availability across campus. They can log in, see lot occupancy, check forecasted availability, and receive notifications when their preferred lots are filling up or clearing out. Users can also favorite specific lots, report open spots or blocked areas, and view fallback recommendations when their favorite lot is full. The backend system aggregates anonymous “enter” and “leave” signals detected through geofencing, calculates real-time occupancy, and generates short- and long-term forecasts using machine learning. Forecasts and occupancy data are displayed within the app, which will help users plan when and where to park.

	Functional and Non-Functional Requirements
Functional Requirements
* Login: Students login with CSULB email.
* Parking Map: Interactive map of all parking lots which are color coded to show occupancy.
* Live Occupancy: Shows % full in real time and updates often.
* Best & Backup Lot: Suggests best lot to park in and offers backup option.
* Notifications: Alerts when lots are almost full or when spots open up.
* Anonymous Logging: Only saves lot entered/lot exited with time stamp. No exact location, paths taken or personal data is saved.
* Forecasting: Predicts occupancy of lots ahead of time. This makes predictions in the short-term(30-60mins) and long-term(daily/weekly parking patterns).
* Weather & Events: Adjusts forecasts given changes in weather or expected campus events.
* User Feedback: Students can correct wrong lot info or report accidents, construction, etc.
* Crowdsourcing: “Spots seen” button so students can report open spaces.
* Transit Integration: Shows shuttle stops and times.
* Navigation: One-tap directions to chosen lot via Google/Apple maps.
* Personalization: Students can favorite certain lots, set alerts and use light/dark mode.
* Special Modes: Detect carpooling, handle early/low usage, show reliability levels.


Non-functional Requirements


Quality Requirements:
* Accuracy: Parking lot information should be accurate most of the time. Forecasts should have confidence ranges.
* Privacy: No storing user location history.
* Battery Friendly: Should not drain phone battery heavily while running in background.
* Scalability: Should handle thousands of students at once.
* Usability: Easy to use, simple interface with accessible design.
* Cross-Platform: Works consistently on iOS and Android.
* Speed: Map should load quickly, within 3 seconds. Data should update within 1 minute.


Constraints:
* Operating System: iOS (initial release), Android (planned)
* Languages/Tools:
   * Frontend: React Native using TypeScript, integrating native modules for geofencing (iOS CoreLocation, Android FusedLocation API)
   * Backend: NestJS (TypeScript, Node.js) for modular, scalable API design
   * Database & Storage: AWS DynamoDB (real-time events, occupancy data) and AWS S3 (archival logs, model data, static assets)
   * Machine Learning: AWS SageMaker for training and serving short-term and long-term forecasting models
   * Hosting & Infrastructure: AWS Lambda (serverless functions), API Gateway, and CloudWatch for monitoring
   * Maps & Geolocation: Apple Maps SDK (iOS) and Google Maps SDK (Android) for displaying parking lots and navigation routes
   * Notifications: APNs for iOS and Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) for Android push alerts
   * Authentication: Email-based login using CSULB student credentials; backend-issued JWT tokens for secure session handling
   * Dev & CI/CD: GitHub (monorepo), GitHub Actions (CI/CD), Docker & Docker Compose (local dev, CI builds)


Development Process
* Deadlines:
   * Working demo connecting frontend and backend with simulated occupancy updates by end of Fall 2025. 
   * Fully integrated real-time system with predictive and community features by end of Spring 2026
* Deliverables:
   * Fall 2025 — Prototype 
      * Interactive campus map with all parking lots(polygons/IDs/capacities
      * Lot sheet showing occupancy buckets (low, medium, high), no % needed
      * Best lot recommendations based on occupancy 
      * Geofence entry/leave detection (iOS CoreLocation/Android Fused Location)
      * Background activity heuristic (drive → walk) for “parked” vs “passing through”
      * Anonymous event logging:  (lotID, enter/leave, timestamp)
      * Notifications: near-full/clearing alerts for locally saved favorites. 
      * Privacy: raw GPS not stored; raw events auto-purged(e.g., 7 days)
      * Real time aggregation updates lot status within
   * Spring 2026 — Full working version
      * Live occupancy map with confidence levels 
      * Forecasting with events and weather
      * Battery-optimized sensing 
      * Crowdsourcing & reporting tools 
      * Carpool mode 
      * Shuttle integration
